      <h1>World Teens — NFT Collection Description</h1>
      <p><b>World Teens</b> is a vibrant NFT collection that celebrates the voices, cultures, and perspectives of teenagers from across the globe. Each artwork features a uniquely designed teen girl or boy who embodies a theme, issue, or highlight from their part of the world — from cultural traditions and sports to climate action, technology, human rights, and creativity.</p>
      <p>The collection presents teens not just as characters, but as storytellers: symbols of curiosity, resilience, and hope for the future. By blending artistic expression with global awareness, <b>World Teens</b> invites collectors to explore how young people shape conversations on identity, culture, and change in today’s interconnected world.</p>
      <p>Every NFT is more than a portrait — it’s a snapshot of a story, a place, and a perspective. Together, the collection forms a digital mosaic of youth who stand as bridges between cultures and as voices for tomorrow.</p>
